The reference material for this course, as well as some useful literature to deepen your knowledge of R, can be found at the bottom of the page.

# User interface

**R** is a free and open source statistical computing and graphics software.
**RStudio** is a user-friendly environment for R, designed to facilitate its accessibility. 
R can technically be used without RStudio (although I wouldn't advise it), but the reverse is not possible. 
To download both, follow the links below:

* [**Download R**](https://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/)
* [**Download RStudio**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

‚úèÔ∏è Download both softwares.

Once you have downloaded both programs and opened RStudio, you will be presented with a window similar to the one shown in the following figure.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/rstudio-window-start.png")
```

* Left pane: Contains the Console, Terminal and Background Jobs tabs.
* Top right pane: contains the Environment, History, Connections and Tutorial tabs.
* Bottom right pane: contains the Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer and Presentation tabs.

## Console

In the **Console tab**, we first see information about the version of R we are using and some basic commands to try out. At the end of these descriptions, we can type our R code, press Enter and see the result below the code line.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
2+2
```

## Help

The `help()` function and `?` help operator in R provide access to the documentation pages for R functions, data sets, and other objects, both for packages in the standard R distribution and for contributed packages.

You can access help directly from the console or via the Help tab in the bottom right-hand corner.

```{r}
help(c)
# or equivalently
? c
```

## Script file

However, when we run our code directly in the console, it isn't saved for being reproduced further. If we need (and we usually do) to write a reproducible code to solve a specific task, we have to record and regularly save it in a **script file** rather than in the console.

To start recording a script, click *File ‚Äì New File ‚Äì R Script*. This will open a text editor in the top-left corner of the RStudio interface (above the Console tab, see following figure).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/rstudio-window.png")
```

üí° When your code starts to get long or complex, consider breaking it down into separate scripts with clear and specific purposes ‚Äî for example:
`1_data_import.R`, `2_data_cleaning.R`, `3_survival_analysis.R`, `4_qol_analysis.R`, etc.

## Comments

Comments can be added to the code in a script using the hash symbol `#`.

```{r}
# Here is a comment.
```

It is very, very important that you always comment every piece of your code, to make sure:

* that you will still be able to understand what you have written after a few months/years.
* to facilitate sharing: without comments, it will take someone much longer to understand your code.

So, for scientific purposes, **please comment your code**!  
Here‚Äôs an example of how I usually comment the scripts I use in my daily work:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

```

üí° Use `----` after numbered headers in comments to make your code more navigable and readable in long scripts (this is a common R style convention).

## Exercises

‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 1: Create your own script. Feel free to take notes directly in it. You‚Äôll use this script as a working document to complete various small tasks and exercises.

‚òëÔ∏è All exercises have an example solution at the end of the chapter.

# Objects, data types, variables

In R, everything is an **object**. This means that every piece of data you work with, from a single number to a complex dataset, is represented as an object with specific properties and behaviours. An object has attributes like class (**data type**) and dimensions.

**Variables** act as labels for objects. They are essentially pointers to the actual object stored in memory and appear in the Environment tab in RStudio.

Here‚Äôs an example to clarify the difference between variables and objects.

```{r}
# We create an object (here: a vector) named 'vec' and assign a sequence of numbers to it.
vec <- 1:10 

# 'vec' is the variable. The sequence of numbers (1, 2, 3, ..., 10) is the object.
```

üí° To assign values to an object, use the `<-` or `=` symbols.

## Inspect an object

Before diving into data types and structures, it's helpful to know how to inspect objects in R. Several built-in functions can help you understand the structure and content of an object.

Let‚Äôs define a simple data frame (more details about data frames below) to demonstrate the purpose of those functions.

```{r}
# Example data frame
df <- data.frame(
  ID = 1:5,
  Name = c("Anna", "Ben", "Carla", "David", "Eva"),
  Age = c(23, 31, 29, 40, 35)
)
```

Now let‚Äôs inspect thus object using a few useful functions.

```{r}
# General object inspection
typeof(df)          # Returns the internal storage type of the object
str(df)             # Gives a compact, human-readable summary of the object's structure
attributes(df)      # Lists the object's attributes (e.g., names, dimensions, class)
str(attributes(df)) # Displays the structure of the attributes
class(df)           # Returns the class of the object (e.g., data.frame)
```

```{r}
# Functions especially useful for matrices or data frames
nrow(df)          # Number of rows
ncol(df)          # Number of columns
dim(df)           # Dimensions (rows, columns)
colnames(df)      # Column names
rownames(df)      # Row names
str(colnames(df)) # Structure of the column names (e.g., character vector)
str(rownames(df)) # Structure of the row names (e.g., character vector)
```

üí° The function `str()` provides a compact view of the internal structure of an R object, helping you understand its components and data types quickly.

## Data types

In R, data types define the kind of information a variable can hold. Here are some of the most common data types:

### Numeric: Represents real numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5, 0).

```{r} 
typeof(3.14)
str(3.14)
```

### Integer: Represents whole numbers (e.g., 2L, -5L). The "L" suffix indicates an integer.

```{r} 
typeof(2L) 
str(2L)
```

### Logical: Represents Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE).

```{r} 
typeof(TRUE)
str(TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Example of a logical operation
values <- 1:10
above_five <- (values > 5)
above_five
```

### Character: Represents text or strings (e.g., "hello", "world").

```{r} 
typeof("hello")
str("hello")
```

### Complex: Represents complex numbers (e.g., 1 + 2i).

```{r} 
typeof(1 + 2i) 
str(1 + 2i)
```

### NAs/NANs

In some cases the components of a vector may not be known. When an element or value is ‚Äúnot available‚Äù or a ‚Äúmissing value‚Äù in the statistical sense, a place within a vector may be reserved for it by assigning it the special value `NA`. In general any operation on an NA becomes an NA.

```{r} 
z <- c(1:3,NA)
print(z)
is.na(z)
```

There is a second kind of ‚Äúmissing‚Äù values which are produced by numerical computation, the so-called Not a Number, `NaN`, values.

```{r} 
0/0
Inf - Inf
```

## Objects

Objects are the entities that R operates on. These can be:

### Vectors
  + The most fundamental data structure.
  + A one-dimensional array of elements of the same data type (e.g., numeric, character, logical).
  + Created using the `c()` function.
  
```{r}
vec1 <- c(1,2,3)
str(vec1)
```

```{r}
# Alternative ways of creating vectors:
vec2 <- 1:3  # Sequence of integers
vec3 <- seq(1, 3, by=1)  # More general sequence
```

Vector elements can be accessed using `[]` brackets.

```{r}
# Accessing elements of the vector by index (R uses 1-based indexing)
vec1[1]  # First element
vec2[c(2, 3)]  # Elements at indices 2 and 3
vec3[c(-2)]  # All elements except for the element at index 2
```

### Matrices
  + Two-dimensional arrays of elements of the same data type.
  + Can be created using the `matrix()` function.
  
```{r, echo=TRUE}
(mat <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2))
str(mat)
```

üí° By enclosing the assignment in parentheses `()`, you not only create the object but also automatically print its value to the console ‚Äî a useful shortcut. This is equivalent to writing `print(object)` or simply typing the object name (e.g., `object`), but it saves you an extra line of code.

### Arrays
  + Generalization of matrices to more than two dimensions.
  
```{r, echo=TRUE}
(array <- array(1:8, c(2,4,2)))
str(array)
```

### Lists
  + Ordered collections of objects, which may be of different types.
  + Lists can contain other lists as elements.
  
```{r}
(list <- list(numb = 10:15, char = 'hello'))
str(list)
```

### Factors
  + Categorical variables.
  + Represent data with a limited number of possible values.

```{r}
(fac <- factor(c("single", "married")))
str(fac)
```

### Data Frames
  + Two-dimensional tabular data structure.
  + Can contain columns of different data types, such as numeric, character, logical, or factor.
  + The most common data structure for representing datasets in R.
  + Technically, a data frame is a special type of list where each element (i.e., column) is of the same length and can be a vector (numeric, character, logical), factor, matrix, list, or even another data frame.
  
```{r}
(d <- data.frame(id = 1:5, 
                 val = c(4,5,2,6,5),
                 group = sample(c("exp","control"), size = 5, replace = TRUE)))
str(d)
```

### Functions
  + Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
  + Also considered objects in R.

```{r}
frac <- function(numerator, denominator) {
  result <- numerator / denominator
  return(result)
}

frac(numerator = 6, denominator = 2) # Calling the function
```

üí° A function takes inputs called arguments. These can be:

  + *Explicitly specified*, e.g., `frac(numerator = 6, denominator = 2)`, or
  + *Implicitly given in order*, e.g., `frac(6, 2)`.
  
I strongly recommend explicitly naming arguments, because it increases clarity, prevents order-related mistakes, and gives you flexibility in argument order: `frac(denominator = 2, numerator = 6)` works just as well. In contrast, when arguments are unnamed, order matters strictly ‚Äî and a small mistake can completely change the result: `frac(2, 6)` is interpreted as `frac(numerator = 2, denominator = 6)`!

## Exercises

‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 2: Given a vector of ages (`ages <- c(35, 45, 60, 15, 50, 8)`), determine which patients are eligible for a treatment (age above 18). Return a Boolean vector indicating whether each patient meets the age criteria.

‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 3: Create a data frame with 10 rows and the columns `id`, `blood_pressure`, and `group`.
‚Äì `id`: integers from 1 to 10
‚Äì `blood_pressure`: random values from a normal distribution with mean 123 and standard deviation 8
‚Äì `group`: a factor with levels "drug 1", "drug 2", and "obs arm" (you decide how to assign them, e.g. by using the function `sample()`)
After creating that data frame, add a new column `stand_score` where you calculate a standardized score for each blood_pressure value. The standardized score is similar to a z-score but is calculated based on the mean and standard deviation of the `blood_pressure` values in the dataset (standardized score = (x‚àíŒº)/œÉ)).

üí° Hint: Use the function `rnorm()` to simulate normal values. Use the function `scale()` to centre and scale a vector, or alternatively the functions `mean()` and `sd()` to compute mean and standard deviation of a vector. You can use `help()` to learn more about how these functions work.

‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 4: Write a function `sum_squared` that takes two integers and returns the sum of their squared values.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Example
sum_squared(int1 = 2, int2 = 3)
# The output should be:
13
```

# Packages

**Packages** are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format, created to add specific functionality.

There is a set of standard (or base) packages which are considered part of the R source code and automatically available as part of your R installation. **Base packages** contain the basic functions that allow R to work, and enable standard statistical and graphical functions on datasets.

On top of that, there are 10,000+ **user contributed packages**. You can install packages using the install.packages() function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# To install a package, you can use the function.
install.packages("dplyr")

# Alternatively, you can click on 'Packages' in the bottom right pane, then click on 'Install' and type in the name of the package you want to install.

# To load a package you've already install, just load it using the library() function.
library(dplyr)
```

## Exercises

‚úèÔ∏è Exercise 5: install and load the `tidyverse` package. We will need it for Chapter 2.
