To explore R’s statistical tools, we’ll continue working with the NHANES datasets. Specifically, we’ll use the merged data frame that combines the `demo`, `bpx`, `bmx` and `smq` data sets. If you still have it loaded from Chapters 2 und 3, you can use it directly. Otherwise, you can download it from the [`data_sets` folder](https://github.com/ClaireMargaux/rforphysicians/tree/main/data_sets) and import it into R.

To be able to use survival data, we will also need the NHANES data set complemented with mortality data. If you still have it loaded from Chapters 3, you can use it directly. Otherwise, you can download it from the [`data_sets` folder](https://github.com/ClaireMargaux/rforphysicians/tree/main/data_sets) and import it into R.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Load the merged_nhanes CSV file
merged_nhanes <- read.csv("/home/claire/Documents/GitHub/rforphysicians/data_sets/merged_nhanes.csv")

# Load the merged_nhanes_with_mort CSV file
merged_nhanes_with_mort <- read.csv("/home/claire/Documents/GitHub/rforphysicians/data_sets/merged_nhanes_with_mort.csv")
```

# Most commonly used statistical tests and models

This chapter will follow the structure outlined below. We will learn how to perform a selection of statistical tests and models in R, categorising them by their objective (e.g. comparing two means or analysing survival).

## What is a statistical test?

Before we start looking at many different <u>statistical hypothesis tests</u>, let us recall the basic structure that they all share, by exploring more in-depth the Student's t-test for two, independent continuous samples.

      <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px; vertical-align: top;">Working on two patients cohorts, the smokers and the non-smokers, one could ask her-/himself if they share the same mean on a continuous variable, e.g. the BMI</td>

    </tr>

A few important comments: 

  + The p-value is the **probability under the null hypothesis** of obtaining a (real-valued) test statistic **at least as extreme** as the one obtained.
  + Loosely speaking, rejection of the null hypothesis implies that there is **sufficient evidence against it**. 
  + It is not possible to prove that the null hypothesis is true: it could always be that with a bigger effect size and/or a larger sample size, we could statistically show the difference that we are trying to demonstrate. So, when a test comes out "negatively" (no statistical significance, $p>\alpha$), it does not mean that our claim is necessarly wrong.
  + On the other hand, even a significant test ($p\leq\alpha$) does not mean that we *irrefutably proved* our claim: in a theoretical world, where we could repeat our experiment 100 times in the same conditions and on the same population, even if our theory is wrong, we would always find a "positive" result ($p\leq\alpha$) in $\alpha\%$ of the cases. That is why consensus, in science, always relies on repeated experiments that (for the vast majority of them*) draw the same conclusion.
  + \* Why is that? Because again, even in a theoretical world, where we could repeat our experiment 100 times in the same conditions, even if our theory is right, we would always find a "negative" result in $\alpha\%$ of the cases.

# Tests for comparing two groups

## Continuous variables

### Student's t-test

<u>1. Null hypothesis</u>

* Means of two groups are equal

<u>2. Type of data</u>

* One or two vectors of continuous variables (e.g. blood pressure in mmHg in two cohorts)

<u>3. Requirements</u>

* Both samples are *approximately normally distributed*. Under weak assumptions, this follows in large samples from the central limit theorem, even when the distribution of observations in each group is non-normal.
* If using Student's original definition of the t-test, the two populations being compared should have the *same variance* (assessable graphically using a Q–Q plot). If the sample sizes in the two groups being compared are equal, Student's original t-test is highly robust to the presence of unequal variances. *Welch's t-test* is insensitive to equality of the variances regardless of whether the sample sizes are similar.
* The data used to carry out the test should either be *sampled independently* from the two populations being compared or be fully paired. This is in general not testable from the data, but if the data are known to be dependent (e.g. paired by test design), a paired test has to be applied.

💡 Independent samples are randomly selected so that their observations are not dependent on the values of other observations.

<u>4. R function</u>

`t.test(x, ...)`: Performs one and two sample t-tests on vectors of data.

<u>5. Important arguments</u>

```
t.test(x, y = NULL,
       alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
       mu = 0, paired = FALSE, var.equal = FALSE,
       conf.level = 0.95, ...)
```

* `x, y`: the vector(s) that contain the data (only one vector in the case of a one-sample t-test, two vectors otherwise).
* `alternative`: a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or "less".
* `mu`: a number indicating the true value of the mean (or difference in means if you are performing a two sample test).
* `paired`: a logical indicating whether you want a paired t-test. 
* `var.equal`: a logical variable indicating whether to treat the two variances as being equal. If `TRUE` then the pooled variance is used to estimate the variance otherwise the Welch (or Satterthwaite) approximation to the degrees of freedom is used.
* `conf.level`: confidence level of the interval (default: 0.95).

💡 "paired" means there is an obvious and meaningful one-to-one correspondence between the data in the first set and the data in the second set, e.g. blood pressure in a set of patients before and after administering a medicine.

<u>6. Example</u>

Let us test if the mean BMI (`BMXBMI`) is significantly different between men and women (` RIAGENDR`).

```{r}
# We quickly check the distribution of the BMI using a Q-Q-plot (even though,
# with such a large sample, this isn't required)
qqnorm(y = merged_nhanes$BMXBMI)

# We create two vectors, with the BMIs of women and men
bmi_women <- merged_nhanes$BMXBMI[merged_nhanes$RIAGENDR == "Female"]
bmi_men <- merged_nhanes$BMXBMI[merged_nhanes$RIAGENDR == "Male"]

# We can start looking at how many non NA entries we have and by computing the means
sum(!is.na(bmi_women));sum(!is.na(bmi_men))
mean(bmi_women, na.rm = TRUE);mean(bmi_men, na.rm = TRUE)
qqplot(x = bmi_women, y = bmi_men)

# We compare their means using a t-test
t.test(x = bmi_women, y = bmi_men, alternative = 'two.sided', var.equal = TRUE, paired = FALSE)
```

* The `t` value is the statistic of the t-test.
* `df` are the degrees of freedom (a characteristics of the underlying distribution of the statistic), depends on the test used (one- or two-sample, paired or unpaired), in this case it is the sum of the two samples minus 2 (3239+3212-2=6449).
* The `p-value` is the probability of getting such a `t` value under the null hypothesis. It is very small: 5.854e-09, so to an $\alpha$-level of 0.05, we say that their is a statistically significant difference between the means of the two groups.
* The 95% CI tells us where the difference in the means lies, to a confidence of 95%. In coherence with the very low p-value, this interval does not contain 0 (which would mean "no difference").
* Finally, the means of both vectors are also computed.

💡 `qqnorm` is a function that produces a normal Q-Q-plot of the values in y. `qqplot` produces a Q-Q-plot of two datasets.

#### Z-test

The z-test is similar to the t-test (continuous variable(s), independent and normally distributed), and its null hypothesis is also that the means of two groups are equal, but it requires to know the standard deviation of your group(s). 

You should favour a z-test to a t-test if the **standard deviation** of the group is **known** and the sample size is greater than or equal to 30.

There is no z-test function available in base R, but in packages like `BSDA` (`z.test(x, ...)`).

### Wilcoxon rank-sum and signed-rank tests

Non-parametric (= makes minimal assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data being studied) "alternative" to the t-test (we do not test exactly the same thing, the t-test compares means, the Wilcoxon test compares distributions).

💡 If working on *paired data*, the test is called **Wilcoxon signed-rank test**, and on *unpaired data* it is called **Wilcoxon rank-sum test** (also called Mann–Whitney U test, Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test, or Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test).

<u>1. Null hypothesis</u>

* Distributions of both groups are identical (there is not one sample that stochastically dominates the other sample)

<u>2. Type of data</u>

* One or two vectors of continuous or ordinal variables (e.g. pain levels in two cohorts)

<u>3. Requirements</u>

* The data used to carry out the test should either be *sampled independently* from the two populations being compared or be fully paired. This is in general not testable from the data, but if the data are known to be dependent (e.g. paired by test design), a paired test has to be applied.
* The differences between paired observations should be *symmetrically distributed* around the median. Unlike the paired t-test, the Wilcoxon test does not require normality but works best when the distribution is roughly symmetric. 

<u>4. R function</u>

`wilcox.test(x, ...)`: Performs one- and two-sample Wilcoxon tests on vectors of data; the latter is also known as ‘Mann-Whitney’ test.

<u>5. Important arguments</u>

```
wilcox.test(x, y = NULL,
            alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
            mu = 0, paired = FALSE, exact = NULL, correct = TRUE,
            conf.int = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95,
            tol.root = 1e-4, digits.rank = Inf, ...)
```

* `x, y`: the vector(s) that contain the data (only one vector in the case of a one-sample Wilcoxon test, two vectors otherwise).
* `alternative`: a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or "less".
* `mu`: a number specifying an optional parameter used to form the null hypothesis. Set `mu = 0` (default) to test if the samples have the same distribution.
* `paired`: a logical indicating whether you want a paired test. If only x is given, or if both x and y are given and paired is TRUE, a **Wilcoxon signed rank test** of the null that the distribution of x (in the one sample case) or of x - y (in the paired two sample case) is symmetric about mu is performed. Otherwise, if both x and y are given and paired is FALSE, a **Wilcoxon rank sum test** (equivalent to the Mann-Whitney test: see the Note) is carried out. In this case, the null hypothesis is that the distributions of x and y differ by a location shift of mu and the alternative is that they differ by some other location shift.
* `conf.level`: confidence level of the interval (default: 0.95).

<u>6. Example</u>

Let us test if the distribution of the BMI (`BMXBMI`) is significantly different between men and women (` RIAGENDR`).

```{r}
# We create two vectors, with the BMIs of women and men
bmi_women <- merged_nhanes$BMXBMI[merged_nhanes$RIAGENDR == "Female"]
bmi_men <- merged_nhanes$BMXBMI[merged_nhanes$RIAGENDR == "Male"]

# We compare their distributions using a Wilcoxon test
wilcox.test(x = bmi_women, y = bmi_men, alternative = 'two.sided', mu = 0, paired = FALSE)
```

* The `W` value is the statistic of the Wilcoxon test (also called `U` statistic).
* The `p-value` is the probability of getting such a `W` value under the null hypothesis. It is very small: 0.0004466, so to an $\alpha$-level of 0.05, we say that their is a statistically significant difference between the distributions of the two groups.

## Categorical variables

### Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test

Both are statistical hypothesis tests used in the analysis of contingency tables. The Chi-square test can be used when the sample sizes are large, Fisher's exact test is valid for all sample sizes (even though in practice it is usually employed when sample sizes are small).

<u>1. Null hypothesis</u>

* There are no differences between the classes in the population (rows and columns are independent)

<u>2. Type of data</u>

* Two categorical variables (e.g. cohort/control and progression of tumour yes/no)

<u>3. Requirements</u>

* Use Fisher's exact test when the *expected count* in one or more of the cells in your contingency table is below 5.

💡 The expected counts are what we expect the numbers in the table to look like if the categorical variables are independent. The excepted count in a cell is always given by the formula: $$\text{expected count} = \frac{\text{sum of row} \cdot \text{sum of column}}{\text{total of table}}$$

<u>4. R function</u>

`chisq.test(x, ...)`: performs chi-square contingency table tests and goodness-of-fit tests.

`fisher.test(x, ...)`: performs Fisher's exact test for testing the null of independence of rows and columns in a contingency table with fixed marginals.

<u>5. Important arguments</u>

```
chisq.test(x, y = NULL, correct = TRUE,
           p = rep(1/length(x), length(x)), rescale.p = FALSE,
           simulate.p.value = FALSE, B = 2000)
```

* `x`: a numeric vector or matrix. `x` and `y` can also both be factors.
* `y`: a numeric vector; ignored if x is a matrix. If `x` is a factor, `y` should be a factor of the same length.


```
fisher.test(x, y = NULL, workspace = 200000, hybrid = FALSE,
            hybridPars = c(expect = 5, percent = 80, Emin = 1),
            control = list(), or = 1, alternative = "two.sided",
            conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95,
            simulate.p.value = FALSE, B = 2000)
```

* `x`: either a two-dimensional contingency table in matrix form, or a factor object.
* `y`: a factor object; ignored if x is a matrix.
* `alternative`: a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or "less". Only used in the $2\times2$ case.
* `conf.int`: logical indicating if a confidence interval for the odds ratio in a $2\times2$ table should be computed (and returned).
* `conf.level`: confidence level for the returned confidence interval. Only used in the $2\times2$ case and if `conf.int = TRUE`.

<u>6. Example</u>

Let us test if the smoking status (`SMQ040`) is significantly different between men and women (` RIAGENDR`).

```{r}
# First, let us categorize the participants in smoking and non smoking
table(merged_nhanes$SMQ040)
merged_nhanes$SMOKE <- case_when(
  merged_nhanes$SMQ040 == "Not at all" ~ "No",
  merged_nhanes$SMQ040 %in% c("Every day", "Some days") ~ "Yes",
  merged_nhanes$SMQ040 == "Refused" ~ NA
)

# Let us visualize the contingency table
(tab <- table(merged_nhanes$SMOKE, merged_nhanes$RIAGENDR))

# What are the expected cell counts in this case?
chisq <- chisq.test(tab)
round(chisq$expected,2)

# Since all cells are >5, we can test the null hypothesis of independence using
# a chi-square test
chisq.test(tab)

# Let us also try to run a Fisher's exact test on the same table
fisher.test(tab)
```

* As it was to be expected (the table of observed and expected frequencies were very similar), the Chi-Square test is non significant (`p-value` = 0.6669).
* Same conclusion for Fisher's exact test. The `estimate` given is an estimation of the odds ratio (only computed in the $2\times2$ case), with a corresponding `95% percent confidence interval`. Note that the $95\%$ confidence interval for the odds ratio contains 1 and that the `p-value` is above 0.05, which is coherent.
* The `X-squared` is the statistic of the Chi-square test (assumed to have a chi-square distribution with `df` degrees of freedom). 
* For Fisher's exact test, the statistic is assumed to have a hypergeometric distribution.

#### McNemar's test

McNemar's test is similar to the Chi-square test ($2\times 2$ contingency table), and its null hypothesis is also that the variables are independent, but it is used on **paired** categorical data. It is often used in practice to compare the sensitivities and specificities for the evaluation of two diagnostic tests on the same group of patients.

The corresponding function in base R is called `mcnemar.test(x,...)`.

# Tests for more than two groups

## Continuous variables

### One-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

The one-way ANOVA is used as an extension to the t-test for differences among at least three groups. When there are only two means to compare, the t-test and the F-test (conducted by the one-way ANOVA) are equivalent.

<u>1. Null hypothesis</u>

* Means of different groups are equal

<u>2. Type of data</u>

* Vectors of continuous variables (e.g. blood pressure in mmHg in different cohorts)

<u>3. Requirements</u>

* The different samples are *approximately normally distributed*. Under weak assumptions, this follows in large samples from the central limit theorem, even when the distribution of observations in each group is non-normal.
* The groups being compared should have the *same variance*. If this is not the case, an approximate method of Welch (1951) can be used, which generalizes the commonly known 2-sample Welch test to the case of arbitrarily many samples.
* The data used to carry out the test should either be *sampled independently* from the populations being compared. ANOVA is not robust to violations to the assumption of independence. 

<u>4. R function</u>

`oneway.test(formula, data, ...)`: Test whether two or more samples from normal distributions have the same means.

<u>5. Important arguments</u>

```
oneway.test(formula, data, subset, na.action, var.equal = FALSE)
```

* `formula`: a formula of the form `lhs ~ rhs` where `lhs` gives the sample values and `rhs` the corresponding groups.
* `data`: an optional matrix or data frame containing the variables in the formula formula.
* `na.action`: a function which indicates what should happen when the data contain NAs.
* `var.equal`: a logical variable indicating whether to treat the variances in the samples as equal. If `TRUE`, then a simple F test for the equality of means in a one-way analysis of variance is performed. If `FALSE`, an approximate method of Welch (1951) is used, which generalizes the commonly known 2-sample Welch test to the case of arbitrarily many samples.

<u>6. Example</u>

Let us test if the mean blood pressure at first reading (`BPXSY1`) is significantly different between different age groups (` RIDAGEYR`).

```{r}
# We first define different age groups to compare them to each other
merged_nhanes <- merged_nhanes %>%
  mutate(AGE_GROUP = cut(RIDAGEYR, breaks = seq(10, 80, 10)))

# Let us have a look at the mean BP values (1st reading) for those groups
merged_nhanes %>%
  group_by(AGE_GROUP) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_BPXSY1 = mean(BPXSY1, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Let us now test the means using a one-way ANOVA
oneway.test(BPXSY1 ~ AGE_GROUP, data = merged_nhanes)
```

* The `F` value is the statistic of the F-test conducted by the one-way ANOVA. It is assumed to have an F distribution.
* `num df` and `denom df` are the degrees of freedom (a characteristics of the underlying distribution of the statistic) for the numerator and the denominator composing the statistic (the F distribution has two different degrees of freedom). The degrees of freedom of the numerator	are the number of groups minus one, and the degrees of freedom of the denominator	are the total sample size minus the number of groups.
* The `p-value` is the probability of getting such an `F` value under the null hypothesis. It is very small: 2.2e-16, so to an $\alpha$-level of 0.05, we say that their is a statistically significant difference between the means of the different groups.


#### Repeated-measures ANOVA

Repeated measures ANOVA is the equivalent of the one-way ANOVA, but for related, not independent groups, and is the extension of the paired t-test.

It can be performed in R using the function `anova_test(data, formula, ...)`.


### Kruskal-Wallis test

Extension of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for more than two groups.

<u>1. Null hypothesis</u>

* Distributions of the different groups are identical (there is not one sample that stochastically dominates one other sample)

<u>2. Type of data</u>

* Vectors of continuous or ordinal variables (e.g. pain levels in different cohorts)

<u>3. Requirements</u>

* The data used to carry out the test should be *sampled independently* from the populations being compared. If the data are known to be paired, a Friedman test has to be applied.
* The observations in each group should follow *similar distributions*.

<u>4. R function</u>

`kruskal.test(formula, data, ...)`: Performs a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test.

<u>5. Important arguments</u>

```
kruskal.test(formula, data, subset, na.action, ...)
```

* `formula`: a formula of the form `response ~ group` where response gives the data values and group a vector or factor of the corresponding groups.
* `data`: a matrix or data frame containing the variables in the formula formula.
* `na.action`: a function which indicates what should happen when the data contain NAs.

<u>6. Example</u>

Let us test if the mean blood pressure at first reading (`BPXSY1`) is significantly different between different age groups (` RIDAGEYR`), just like we did with the one-way ANOVA.

```{r}
# We first define different age groups to compare them to each other
merged_nhanes <- merged_nhanes %>%
  mutate(AGE_GROUP = cut(RIDAGEYR, breaks = seq(10, 80, 10)))

# Let us have a look at the distributions of the BP values (1st reading) for those groups
ggplot(merged_nhanes, aes(x = AGE_GROUP, y = BPXSY1)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    x = "Age group",
    y = "Systolic BP in mmHg",
    title = "Blood pressure (1st reading) by age group"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Let us now test the distributions using a Kruskal-Wallis test
kruskal.test(BPXSY1 ~ AGE_GROUP, data = merged_nhanes)
```

* The `Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared` value is the statistic of the Kruskal-Wallis test (it is also called `H` statistic). In is assumed to follow a Chi-square distribution with $k-1$ (k beeing the number of groups) degrees of freedom (`df`).
* The `p-value` is the probability of getting such a value under the null hypothesis. It is very small: 2.2e-16, so to an $\alpha$-level of 0.05, we say that their is a statistically significant difference between the distributions of the different groups.


#### Friedman test

Generalization of paired tests (e.g., Wilcoxon) for more than two related groups. It is the non-parametric equivalent of the repeated-measures ANOVA.

It can be performed in R using the function `friedman.test(formula, data, ...)`.


## Categorical variables

### Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test



# Tests for distribution and normality

Test for deviations from normality, set the stage for determining when to use parametric vs. non-parametric tests.

## Shapiro-Wilk test

## Lilliefors test


# Tests for survival analysis

## Log-Rank test

For analysing time-to-event data. Mention Kaplan-Meier curves for context.


# Correlation and association tests

## Correlation test by Pearson

Basis for understanding relationships between two continuous, normally distributed variables.

## Correlation test by Spearman

Non-parametric alternative for monotonic relationships.

# Regression

## Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)

Purpose: GLMs are an extension of linear models that allow for non-normal distributions of the response variable (e.g., binary, count, or categorical outcomes). They offer more flexibility than traditional linear regression by using different link functions and error distributions.

Key Features: 

Linear relationship: GLMs assume a linear relationship between the predictors and the transformed response variable.

Link function: Links the linear predictor to the mean of the distribution. Common link functions:

* Identity link for normal distribution (linear regression)
* Logit link for binomial distribution (logistic regression)
* Log link for Poisson distribution (Poisson regression)

Error distributions: GLMs can be applied with various error distributions:
* Normal for continuous data (linear regression)
* Binomial for binary data (logistic regression)
* Poisson for count data

Assumptions

* Independence: Observations must be independent.
* Distribution: The response variable follows an appropriate distribution (e.g., binomial for binary outcomes, Poisson for count data).

Common Applications

* Linear regression: Predicting a continuous outcome.
* Logistic regression: Predicting binary outcomes (e.g., yes/no, success/failure).
* Poisson regression: Modeling count data (e.g., number of events in a fixed time period).
* Cox regression: A form of survival analysis used to model time-to-event data, often with censored observations. It is based on the proportional hazards assumption and estimates the effect of predictor variables on the hazard (event occurrence rate).

### Linear regression

Purpose: Used to model the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
Assumptions: Linearity, normality of residuals, homoscedasticity, independence.
Example Application: Predicting the price of a house based on square footage, number of rooms, etc.

### Logistic regression

Purpose: Used when the dependent variable is binary (e.g., yes/no, success/failure).
Assumptions: Linear relationship between the log-odds of the outcome and predictors.
Example Application: Predicting the likelihood of a disease based on age, gender, and other factors.

## Cox (proportional hazards) regression

Purpose: Used for survival analysis, particularly when studying the time to an event (e.g., time to death, relapse).
Assumptions: Proportional hazards assumption, meaning the effect of the predictor on the hazard rate is constant over time.
Example Application: Analyzing the impact of age, treatment type, and other covariates on patient survival times.
