# NHANES data sets

The National Health and Nutrition Examination ([`NHANES`](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/)) Survey from 2011-2012 assessed overall health and nutrition of adults and children in the United States and was conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The data sets can be found in the [`data_sets` folder](https://github.com/ClaireMargaux/rforphysicians/tree/main/data_sets).

| Dataset               | NHANES Code | Description                                                       | File                                    |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Demographics          | DEMO\_G     | Age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, education                       | `DEMO_G.csv`                            |
| Blood Pressure        | BPX\_G      | Systolic/diastolic blood pressure, number of readings             | `BPX_G.csv`                             |
| Body Measures         | BMX\_G      | Height, weight, BMI, waist circumference                          | `BMX_G.csv`                             |
| Smoking Questionnaire | SMQ\_G      | Smoking habits, exposure to secondhand smoke                      | `SMQ_G.csv`                             |
| Mortality Data        | NDI         | Mortality follow-up data (status, follow-up time, cause of death) | `NHANES_2011_2012_MORT.dat`            |

ðŸ’¡ The codebook for each data set can be accessed either on the [`NCHS website`](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2011) or directly in `R` using the function `nhanesCodebook(nh_table, colname)` from the package `nhanesA` (which I used to download the data).

Follows a list of some of the key variables from the NHANES data sets.
