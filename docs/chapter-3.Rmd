The reference material for this course, as well as some useful literature to deepen your knowledge of R, can be found at the bottom of the page.

***************

The base R plotting functions are effective and user-friendly, so we will begin by exploring their features.

Next, we will take a look at the functions offered by `ggplot2`, a system for declarative graphics creation. You provide the data and specify how to map variables to aesthetics and which graphical primitives to use; ggplot2 then takes care of the details. Although it is slightly more technical than base R, it produces very aesthetically pleasing results.

To explore R‚Äôs plotting capabilities, we‚Äôll continue working with the NHANES datasets. Specifically, we‚Äôll use the merged data frame that combines the `demo`, `bpx`, `bmx` and `smq` data sets. If you still have it loaded from Chapter 2, you can use it directly. Otherwise, you can download it from the [`data_sets` folder](https://github.com/ClaireMargaux/rforphysicians/tree/main/data_sets) and import it into R.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Load the merged_nhanes CSV file
merged_nhanes <- read.csv("/home/claire/Documents/GitHub/rforphysicians/data_sets/merged_nhanes.csv")
```

# Including plots using base R

## Scatter plots

```{r, out.width="75%"}
plot(x = merged_nhanes$RIDAGEYR, y = merged_nhanes$BPXSY1,
     xlab = "Age of participant [years]",
     ylab = "Systolic blood pressure (1st reading) [mmHg]",
     main = "Scatterplot of age vs. systolic BP",
     col = c("steelblue"))
```

üí° The arguments `xlab` and `ylab` allow fyou to define a label for the x and y axes respectively. The argument `main` defines the main title of the plot.

## Box plots

```{r, out.width="75%"}
boxplot(merged_nhanes$BPXSY1 ~ merged_nhanes$RIAGENDR,
        names = c("Male", "Female"),
        xlab = "Gender",
        ylab = "Systolic blood pressure (1st reading) [mmHg]",
        main = "Boxplot of BP by gender",
        col = c("salmon", "skyblue"))
```

## Bar plots

```{r, out.width="75%"}
# We define the age groups in which to calculate the mean systolic blood pressure and calculate the mean systolic blood pressure by age group
avg_bp <- merged_nhanes %>%
  filter(!is.na(BPXSY1), !is.na(RIDAGEYR)) %>%             # Remove NAs
  mutate(age_group = cut(RIDAGEYR, breaks = seq(10, 80, 10))) %>%  # Define age groups
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(mean_bp = mean(BPXSY1, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

barplot(height = avg_bp$mean_bp,
        names.arg = avg_bp$age_group,
        xlab = "Age group [years]",
        ylab = "Average systolic BP [mmHg]",
        main = "Bar plot of average systolic BP by age group",
        col = "steelblue")
```

üí° `cut()` divides the range of the imputed vector into intervals and codes its values according to which interval they fall. The leftmost interval corresponds to level one, the next leftmost to level two and so on.

## Histograms

```{r, out.width="75%"}
hist(merged_nhanes$BMXBMI,
     breaks = 30,
     freq = TRUE,
     col = "steelblue",
     xlab = "Body Mass Index (BMI)",
     main = "Histogram of BMI")
```

üí° The argument `breaks` is a vector giving the breakpoints between histogram cells or a function to compute the vector of breakpoints.

üí° The argument `freq` is a logical: if TRUE, the histogram graphic is a representation of frequencies, the counts component of the result; if FALSE, probability densities, component density, are plotted.

## Line plots

```{r, out.width="75%"}
# We define the age groups in which to calculate the mean systolic blood pressure and calculate the mean systolic blood pressure by age group
avg_bp_with_midpoints <- merged_nhanes %>%
  filter(!is.na(BPXSY1), !is.na(RIDAGEYR)) %>%
  mutate(age_group = cut(RIDAGEYR, breaks = seq(10, 80, 10))) %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(mean_bp = mean(BPXSY1)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    # Add midpoints
    age_mid = seq(15, 75, 10)
  )

plot(avg_bp_with_midpoints$age_mid, avg_bp_with_midpoints$mean_bp, type = "b",
     xlab = "Age (midpoint of group) [years]",
     ylab = "Mean systolic BP [mmHg]",
     main = "Mean systolic BP by age group",
     col = "steelblue")
```

üí° The argument `type` is 1-character string giving the type of plot desired. The following values are possible:

  + "p" for *points*
  + "l" for *lines*
  + "b" for *both points and lines*
  + "c" for empty points joined by lines
  + "o" for overplotted points and lines
  + "s" and "S" for stair steps and "h" for histogram-like vertical lines

## Pie charts

```{r, out.width="75%"}
(gender_table <- table(merged_nhanes$RIAGENDR))
pie(x = gender_table,
    labels = c("Female", "Male"),
    col = c("skyblue", "salmon"),
    main = "Gender Distribution")
```

üí° `table()` uses cross-classifying factors to build a contingency table of the counts at each combination of factor levels.

Personally, I would recommend *avoiding* pie charts, as the human eye is not very good at recognising angle ratios. I favour bar plots, for example.

## Mosaic plots

```{r, out.width="75%"}
(smoking_gender_table <- table(merged_nhanes$RIAGENDR, merged_nhanes$SMQ020))
mosaicplot(smoking_gender_table[,c("Yes","No")], # we select only the 'yes/no' answers
           main = "Mosaic plot of smoking status by gender",
           xlab = "Gender",
           ylab = "Smoked at least 100 cigarettes?",
           col = c("steelblue"))
```

## Forest plots

Base R does not include a built-in function for forest plots, but you can use a package like `forestplot` for that, or `ggplot2` (see below).

```{r, out.width="75%"}
library(forestplot)

# Calculate summary statistics by gender
summary_stats <- merged_nhanes %>%
  filter(!is.na(BPXSY1)) %>%                      # Remove NAs for BPXSY1
  group_by(RIAGENDR) %>%                          # Group by gender
  summarise(
    mean = mean(BPXSY1),
    sd = sd(BPXSY1),
    n = n(),
    lower = mean - 1.96 * sd / sqrt(n),
    upper = mean + 1.96 * sd / sqrt(n)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

# Create the forest plot
forestplot(labeltext = c("Female","Male"),
           mean = summary_stats$mean,
           lower = summary_stats$lower,
           upper = summary_stats$upper,
           zero = 120,
           grid = TRUE,
           ci.vertices = TRUE,
           xlab = "Systolic BP (95% CI) [mmHg]",
           col = fpColors(box = "steelblue", line = "steelblue"),
           title = "Forest plot of systolic BP by gender")
```

## Exercises

‚úèÔ∏è Exercise on plotting with base R n¬∞1: Plot the first, second and third systolic blood pressure readings by gender using base R. Display all three plots (1st, 2nd and 3rd readings) in the same output panel.

üí° *Hint:* Try using the `par()` function (e.g. `par(mfrow=c(2,3))`; do not forget to reset it to `par(mfrow=c(1,1))` afterwards!)

‚úèÔ∏è Exercise on plotting with base R n¬∞2: Create a histogram showing the systolic blood pressure (1st reading) for each smoking status category (excluding those who refused to provide their smoking status). Set the number of breaks to 20. You should get three different plots. Display them all in the same output panel.

# Including plots using `ggplot2`

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Start by installing ggplot2
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2) # after installation

# Note that the ggplot2 package is included in some R package collections, e.g. the tidyverse collection
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse) # after installation
```

`ggplot2` is based on the grammar of graphics ‚Äî the idea that every graph can be built from the same basic components:

* a *data set*, 
* a *coordinate system*, and
* *geoms*: visual marks (like points, lines, bars) that represent data.
 
Structure of a `ggplot2` graph:

```{r ggplot2-structure, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/ggplot2-structure.png")
```

How to build a plot:

  1. Start with `ggplot()`, where you provide the dataset (and optionally the aesthetic mapping).
  2. Add layers, such as:

  + `geom_point()` (scatter plot)
  + `geom_histogram()` (histogram)
  + `geom_line()` (line plot)
  + `scales` (e.g., scale_y_log10())
  + `faceting` (e.g., facet_wrap())
  + `coordinate systems` (e.g., coord_flip())

  3. Define aesthetics using `aes()`: these describe how variables in the data are mapped to visual properties like: x, y, color, fill, linetype, size, etc.

üí° You can place `aes()` either in `ggplot()` (to apply it *globally*) or inside the individual `geom_*()` functions (to apply it *locally*).

The geom function must be chosen according to the type of data examined (two continuous variables, one categorical and one continuous variable, etc.).

## Scatter plots

```{r, out.width="75%"}
ggplot(merged_nhanes, aes(x = RIDAGEYR, y = BPXSY1)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, col = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of age vs. systolic BP",
       x = "Age of participant [years]",
       y = "Systolic blood pressure (1st reading) [mmHg]") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Or equivalently:

```{r, out.width="75%"}
ggplot(merged_nhanes) +
  geom_point(aes(x = RIDAGEYR, y = BPXSY1), alpha = 0.5, col = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of age vs. systolic BP",
       x = "Age of participant [years]",
       y = "Systolic blood pressure (1st reading) [mmHg]") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Box plots

```{r, out.width="75%"}
ggplot(data = merged_nhanes, aes(x = factor(RIAGENDR, labels = c("Male", "Female")), y = BPXSY1, fill = factor(RIAGENDR))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("salmon", "skyblue")) +
  labs(title = "Box plot of systolic BP by gender",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "Systolic BP (1st reading) [mmHg]") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Bar plots 

```{r, out.width="75%"}
ggplot(avg_bp, aes(x = age_group, y = mean_bp)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Bar plot of mean systolic BP by age group",
       x = "Age group [years]",
       y = "Mean systolic BP [mmHg]") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## Histograms

```{r, out.width="75%"}
ggplot(merged_nhanes, aes(x = BMXBMI)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "steelblue", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of BMI",
       x = "Body Mass Index (BMI)",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

üí° A quick reminder that the number of bins in a histogram is extremely important and should be given careful consideration, as the appearance of the data can vary significantly depending on this choice, which could potentially be misleading.

An example with the age of the household reference person:

```{r, out.width="75%"}
ggplot(merged_nhanes, aes(x = DMDHRAGE)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 40, fill = "steelblue", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of age of the household reference person (40 bins)",
       x = "Age [years]",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(merged_nhanes, aes(x = DMDHRAGE)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "steelblue", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of age of the household reference person (20 bins)",
       x = "Age [years]",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(merged_nhanes, aes(x = DMDHRAGE)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = "steelblue", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of age of the household reference person (10 bins)",
       x = "Age [years]",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Line plots

```{r, out.width="75%"}
ggplot(avg_bp_with_midpoints, aes(x = age_mid, y = mean_bp)) +
  geom_line(col = "steelblue") +
  geom_point(col = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Mean systolic BP by age group",
       x = "Age (midpoint of group) [years]",
       y = "Mean systolic BP [mmHg]") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Pie charts

```{r, out.width="75%"}
# Count proportions for each gender
gender_counts <- merged_nhanes %>%
  filter(!is.na(RIAGENDR)) %>%                     # Remove NAs if any
  count(Gender = RIAGENDR) %>%                      # Count by gender, rename column to 'Gender'
  mutate(
    prop = n / sum(n),                              # Compute proportion
    ypos = cumsum(prop) - 0.5 * prop                # Compute y position for label
  )

ggplot(gender_counts, aes(x = "", y = prop, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_col(width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  geom_text(aes(y = ypos, label = scales::percent(prop)), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("salmon", "skyblue")) +
  labs(title = "Pie chart of gender distribution") +
  theme_void()
```

## Mosaic plots

`ggplot2` does not include a built-in function for mosaic plots, but can be extended with the `ggmoisaic` package for that.

```{r, out.width="75%"}
library(ggmosaic)

ggplot(data = merged_nhanes[merged_nhanes$SMQ020 %in% c("Yes","No"),]) +
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(RIAGENDR), fill = SMQ020)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("salmon", "skyblue")) +
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Smoked at least 100 cigarettes?", title = "Mosaic plot of smoking status by gender") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Forest plots

```{r, out.width="75%"}
# Calculate summary statistics by gender
forest_df <- merged_nhanes %>%
  filter(!is.na(BPXSY1), !is.na(RIAGENDR)) %>%
  group_by(Gender = RIAGENDR) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(BPXSY1),
    sd = sd(BPXSY1),
    n = n(),
    lower = mean - 1.96 * sd / sqrt(n),
    upper = mean + 1.96 * sd / sqrt(n),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

ggplot(forest_df, aes(x = mean, y = Gender)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = lower, xmax = upper), height = 0.2, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 120, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Forest plot of systolic BP by gender",
       x = "Systolic BP (95% CI) [mmHg]",
       y = "") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Exercises

‚úèÔ∏è Exercise on plotting with `ggplot2`: Using the same age groups as in the examples, create a bar plot showing the median BMI by age group. Then produce two further bar plots showing the same data for each gender, and display them in the same output panel, using the same y-axis to allow for better comparison.

üí° *Hints:* Try using the `grid.arrange()` function from the `gridExtra` package (e.g. `grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol=2)`), and the argument `ylim` in the `ggplot()` function.

# Saving plots

## Base R

We would use the `jpeg()` function to save a plot as a JPEG image and the `png()` function to save it as a PNG image.
Please note that after the plotting and saving, we need to call the function `dev.off()` to save the file.

We can specify the resolution we want with arguments width and height. We can also specify the full path of the file we want to save if we don't want to save it in the current directory.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plotting_directory <- "/home/claire/Documents/GitHub/rforphysicians/docs/plots/"

jpeg(file = paste0(plotting_directory,"hist_BMI.jpeg"), 
     width = 10, 
     height = 6, 
     units = "in",
     res=100)
hist(merged_nhanes$BMXBMI,
     breaks = 30,
     freq = TRUE,
     col = "steelblue",
     xlab = "Body Mass Index (BMI)",
     main = "Histogram of BMI")
dev.off()

png(file= paste0(plotting_directory,"pie_chart_gender.png"), 
    width = 10, 
    height = 6, 
    units="in",
    res=100)
pie(x = gender_table,
    labels = c("Female", "Male"),
    col = c("skyblue", "salmon"),
    main = "Gender Distribution")
dev.off()
```

## `ggplot2`

Saving plots created using the `ggplot2` package is very easy with the `ggsave()` function. However, the plot must first be stored in a variable; otherwise, the function will simply save the last plot displayed. The function guesses the type of graphics from the file extension.

We can specify the resolution we want with arguments width and height. We can also specify the full path of the file we want to save if we don't want to save it in the current directory.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
boxplot_syst_bp_by_gender <- 
  ggplot(data = merged_nhanes, aes(x = factor(RIAGENDR, labels = c("Male", "Female")), y = BPXSY1, fill = factor(RIAGENDR))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("salmon", "skyblue")) +
  labs(title = "Box plot of systolic BP by gender",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "Systolic BP (1st reading) [mmHg]") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

ggsave(filename = "boxplot_syst_bp_by_gender.png",
  plot = boxplot_syst_bp_by_gender,
  bg = 'white',
  width = 10,
  height = 6,
  units = c("in"),
  path = plotting_directory)
```

## Exercises
