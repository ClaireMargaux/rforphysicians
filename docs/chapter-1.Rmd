# Basics of coding in R

*R* is a free and open source statistical computing and graphics software.
*RStudio* is a user-friendly environment for R, designed to facilitate its accessibility. 
R can technically be used without RStudio (although I wouldn't advise it), but the reverse is not possible. 
To download both, follow the links below:

* [**Download R**](https://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/)
* [**Download RStudio**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

Once you have downloaded both programs and opened RStudio, you will be presented with a window similar to the one shown in Figure \ref{fig:rstudio-window-start}.

```{r rstudio-window-start, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "RStudio window"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/rstudio-window-start.png")
```

* Left pane: Contains the Console, Terminal and Background Jobs tabs.
* Top right pane: contains the Environment, History, Connections and Tutorial tabs.
* Bottom right pane: contains the Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer and Presentation tabs.

## Console

In the **Console tab**, we first see information about the version of R we are using and some basic commands to try out. At the end of these descriptions, we can type our R code, press Enter and see the result below the code line.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
2+2
```

## Help

The `help()` function and `?` help operator in R provide access to the documentation pages for R functions, data sets, and other objects, both for packages in the standard R distribution and for contributed packages.

You can access help directly from the console or via the Help tab in the bottom right-hand corner.

```{r}
help(c)
# or equivalently
? c
```

## Script file

However, when we run our code directly in the console, it isn't saved for being reproduced further. If we need (and we usually do) to write a reproducible code to solve a specific task, we have to record and regularly save it in a **script file** rather than in the console.

To start recording a script, click *File ‚Äì New File ‚Äì R Script*. This will open a text editor in the top-left corner of the RStudio interface (above the Console tab, see Figure \ref{fig:rstudio-window}).

```{r rstudio-window, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "RStudio window"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/rstudio-window.png")
```

‚úèÔ∏è Create your own script. Feel free to take notes directly in it. You‚Äôll use this script as a working document to complete various small tasks and exercises.

‚òëÔ∏è All exercises have an example solution at the end of the chapter.

üí° When your code starts to get long or complex, consider breaking it down into separate scripts with clear and specific purposes ‚Äî for example:
`1_data_import.R`, `2_data_cleaning.R`, `3_survival_analysis.R`, `4_qol_analysis.R`, etc.

## Comments

Comments can be added to the code in a script using the hash symbol `#`.

```{r}
# Here is a comment.
```

It is very, very important that you always comment every piece of your code, to make sure:

* that you will still be able to understand what you have written after a few months/years.
* to facilitate sharing: without comments, it will take someone much longer to understand your code.

So, for scientific purposes, **please comment your code**!  
Here‚Äôs an example of how I usually comment the scripts I use in my daily work:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

```

üí° Use `----` after numbered headers in comments to make your code more navigable and readable in long scripts (this is a common R style convention).

## Objects, data types, variables

In R, everything is an **object**. This means that every piece of data you work with, from a single number to a complex dataset, is represented as an object with specific properties and behaviours. An object has attributes like class (data type) and dimensions.

**Variables** act as labels for objects. They are essentially pointers to the actual object stored in memory and appear in the Environment tab in RStudio.

Here‚Äôs an example to clarify the difference between variables and objects.

```{r}
# We create an object (here: a vector) named 'vec' and assign a sequence of numbers to it.
vec <- 1:10 

# 'vec' is the variable. The sequence of numbers (1, 2, 3, ..., 10) is the object.
```

üí° To assign values to an object, use the `<-` or `=` symbols.

### Inspect an object

Before diving into data types and structures, it's helpful to know how to inspect objects in R. Several built-in functions can help you understand the structure and content of an object.

Let‚Äôs define a simple data frame (more details about data frames below) to demonstrate the purpose of those functions.

```{r}
# Example data frame
df <- data.frame(
  ID = 1:5,
  Name = c("Anna", "Ben", "Carla", "David", "Eva"),
  Age = c(23, 31, 29, 40, 35)
)
```

Now let‚Äôs inspect thus object using a few useful functions.

```{r}
# General object inspection
typeof(df)          # Returns the internal storage type of the object
str(df)             # Gives a compact, human-readable summary of the object's structure
attributes(df)      # Lists the object's attributes (e.g., names, dimensions, class)
str(attributes(df)) # Displays the structure of the attributes
class(df)           # Returns the class of the object (e.g., data.frame)
```

```{r}
# Functions especially useful for matrices or data frames
nrow(df)          # Number of rows
ncol(df)          # Number of columns
dim(df)           # Dimensions (rows, columns)
colnames(df)      # Column names
rownames(df)      # Row names
str(colnames(df)) # Structure of the column names (e.g., character vector)
str(rownames(df)) # Structure of the row names (e.g., character vector)
```

üí° The function `str()` provides a compact view of the internal structure of an R object, helping you understand its components and data types quickly.

### Data types

In R, data types define the kind of information a variable can hold. Here are some of the most common data types:

#### Numeric: Represents real numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5, 0).

```{r} 
typeof(3.14)
str(3.14)
```

#### Integer: Represents whole numbers (e.g., 2L, -5L). The "L" suffix indicates an integer.

```{r} 
typeof(2L) 
str(2L)
```

#### Logical: Represents Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE).

```{r} 
typeof(TRUE)
str(TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Example of a logical operation
values <- 1:10
above_five <- (values > 5)
above_five
```

‚úèÔ∏è Exercise on Booleans: Given a vector of ages (`ages <- c(35, 45, 60, 15, 50, 8)`), determine which patients are eligible for a treatment (age above 18). Return a Boolean vector indicating whether each patient meets the age criteria.

#### Character: Represents text or strings (e.g., "hello", "world").

```{r} 
typeof("hello")
str("hello")
```

#### Complex: Represents complex numbers (e.g., 1 + 2i).

```{r} 
typeof(1 + 2i) 
str(1 + 2i)
```

#### NAs/NANs

In some cases the components of a vector may not be known. When an element or value is ‚Äúnot available‚Äù or a ‚Äúmissing value‚Äù in the statistical sense, a place within a vector may be reserved for it by assigning it the special value `NA`. In general any operation on an NA becomes an NA.

```{r} 
z <- c(1:3,NA)
print(z)
is.na(z)
```

There is a second kind of ‚Äúmissing‚Äù values which are produced by numerical computation, the so-called Not a Number, `NaN`, values.

```{r} 
0/0
Inf - Inf
```

### Objects

Objects are the entities that R operates on. These can be:

#### Vectors
  + The most fundamental data structure.
  + A one-dimensional array of elements of the same data type (e.g., numeric, character, logical).
  + Created using the `c()` function.
  
```{r}
vec1 <- c(1,2,3)
str(vec1)
```

```{r}
# Alternative ways of creating vectors:
vec2 <- 1:3  # Sequence of integers
vec3 <- seq(1, 3, by=1)  # More general sequence
```

Vector elements can be accessed using `[]` brackets.

```{r}
# Accessing elements of the vector by index (R uses 1-based indexing)
vec1[1]  # First element
vec2[c(2, 3)]  # Elements at indices 2 and 3
vec3[c(-2)]  # All elements except for the element at index 2
```

#### Matrices
  + Two-dimensional arrays of elements of the same data type.
  + Can be created using the `matrix()` function.
  
```{r, echo=TRUE}
(mat <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2))
str(mat)
```

üí° By enclosing the assignment in parentheses `()`, you not only create the object but also automatically print its value to the console ‚Äî a useful shortcut. This is equivalent to writing `print(object)` or simply typing the object name (e.g., `object`), but it saves you an extra line of code.

#### Arrays
  + Generalization of matrices to more than two dimensions.
  
```{r, echo=TRUE}
(array <- array(1:8, c(2,4,2)))
str(array)
```

#### Lists
  + Ordered collections of objects, which may be of different types.
  + Lists can contain other lists as elements.
  
```{r}
(list <- list(numb = 10:15, char = 'hello'))
str(list)
```

#### Factors
  + Categorical variables.
  + Represent data with a limited number of possible values.

```{r}
(fac <- factor(c("single", "married")))
str(fac)
```

#### Data Frames
  + Two-dimensional tabular data structure.
  + Can contain columns of different data types, such as numeric, character, logical, or factor.
  + The most common data structure for representing datasets in R.
  + Technically, a data frame is a special type of list where each element (i.e., column) is of the same length and can be a vector (numeric, character, logical), factor, matrix, list, or even another data frame.
  
```{r}
(d <- data.frame(id = 1:5, 
                 val = c(4,5,2,6,5),
                 group = sample(c("exp","control"), size = 5, replace = TRUE)))
str(d)
```

‚úèÔ∏è Create a data frame with 10 rows and the columns `id`, `blood_pressure`, and `group`.
‚Äì `id`: integers from 1 to 10
‚Äì `blood_pressure`: random values from a normal distribution with mean 123 and standard deviation 8
‚Äì `group`: a factor with levels "drug 1", "drug 2", and "obs arm" (you decide how to assign them, e.g. by using the function `sample()`)
After creating that data frame, add a new column `stand_score` where you calculate a standardized score for each blood_pressure value. The standardized score is similar to a z-score but is calculated based on the mean and standard deviation of the `blood_pressure` values in the dataset (standardized score = (x‚àíŒº)/œÉ)).

üí° Use the function `rnorm()` to simulate normal values. Use the function `scale()` to centre and scale a vector, or alternatively the functions `mean()` and `sd()` to compute mean and standard deviation of a vector. You can use `help()` to learn more about how these functions work.

#### Functions
  + Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
  + Also considered objects in R.

```{r}
frac <- function(numerator, denominator) {
  result <- numerator / denominator
  return(result)
}

frac(6, 2)  # Calling the function
```

‚úèÔ∏è Write a function `sum_squared` that takes two integers and returns the sum of their squared values.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Example
sum_squared(2,3)
# The output should be:
13
```

## Working directory

When you get a file from somewhere on your computer (e.g. a dataset), you can either 

* have it in your **R working directory** (see below), in which case you don't need to specify the full path to the file when you import it, 
* or you can get files in different folders, by always specifying the full path.

The advantage of putting the files in the folder that contains your script and is set as the working directory is that you can easily move the folder around on your computer without getting any problems with your script: just set the working directory to your source file every time you open it, and you'll be fine.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Example
setwd("~/home/claire/Documents/GitHub/rforphysicians/docs")
data <- read.csv("testdata.csv")
```

The advantage of always giving the full path to a file is that you can get data in different folders on your computer, avoiding things like copying the source data in every folder where you have a corresponding script.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Example
data <- read.csv("~/home/claire/Documents/GitHub/rforphysicians/docs/testdata.csv")
```

To find out what your current working directory is, you can use the function `getwd()`.

```{r}
getwd()
```

**Working directory**

To tell R which folder you are working in (e.g., where your data is stored), you have several options:

  + Go to *Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory* and select your folder manually.
  + Use `setwd("path/to/your/folder")` in your script.
  + Or, the most convenient for script-based work: go to *Session > Set Working Directory > To Source File Location* to automatically set the working directory to the location of your script.

üí° I recommend placing both your script and your data files in the same folder, and setting that folder as your working directory. This helps avoid errors caused by R not finding your data.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
getwd()                       # Displays the current working directory
setwd("path/to/your/folder")  # Sets the working directory
```

## Import data

We will first look at how to import a CSV file into R as a data frame.

CSV stands for Comma-Separated Values. In a `.csv` file, the values are stored as plain text, separated by commas. This is a simple and widely used format for storing tabular data.

After setting your working directory or determining the path to your CSV file, you can use the `read.csv()` function to import the data. This will create a data frame, which is one of the most commonly used structures in R for handling datasets.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Import a CSV file into a data frame
dataset <- read.csv("~/home/claire/Documents/GitHub/rforphysicians/docs/testdata.csv")

# Check the class of the imported object
class(dataset)
```

üí° I recommend using data frames ‚Äî they are generally easier to work with than matrices, especially for beginners.

Another widely used data format is the Excel file (`.xlsx`). For these, you can use the `readxl` package to import the data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load the readxl package
library(readxl)

# Read the first sheet of an Excel file
dataset <- read_excel("~/home/claire/Documents/datasets.xlsx")
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If your file is actually a CSV but mistakenly has a .xlsx extension, you should rename it to .csv and use read.csv() instead. Mixing up formats can lead to import errors.

## Handling data frames

Let us now look at a data frame to learn how to call or modify its elements. To do this, we will use multiple health data sets from the National Health and Nutrition Examination ([`NHANES`](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/)) Survey. The survey assessed overall health and nutrition of adults and children in the United States and was conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The data sets can [`docs` folder](https://github.com/ClaireMargaux/rforphysicians/tree/main/docs).

```{r}
install.packages('nhanesA')
library(nhanesA)
demo <- nhanes("DEMO_G")   # Demographics (cycle G = 2011‚Äì2012)
bpx  <- nhanes("BPX_G")    # Blood pressure
bmx  <- nhanes("BMX_G")    # Body measures
smq  <- nhanes("SMQ_G")    # Smoking questionnaire
class(HealthCare_Dataset) # we check that we are dealing with a data frame
head(HealthCare_Dataset) # head() returns the first parts of an object
```

### Accessing elements in data frames

Being able to access elements in a data frame is essential when working with data. Here are some common methods to select specific elements, rows, or columns.

```{r}
# Select columns by name
HealthCare_Dataset[, c("Age", "Blood_Pressure")]  # Selecting Age and Blood_Pressure columns
vars <- c("Age", "Blood_Pressure")
HealthCare_Dataset[, vars]  # Alternative using variable `vars`

# Select elements by position
HealthCare_Dataset[1,1] # Access the first element of the first column
ind_mat <- cbind(c(1, 3, 5), c(2, 4, 6))
HealthCare_Dataset[ind_mat]  # Access rows and columns using multiple indices

# Select rows based on a condition
HealthCare_Dataset[, "Blood_Pressure"] > 120  # Logical condition for Blood_Pressure greater than 120
HealthCare_Dataset[HealthCare_Dataset[, "Blood_Pressure"] > 120, ]  # Rows where Blood_Pressure > 120
HealthCare_Dataset[, "Age"] > 50  # Age greater than 50
!(HealthCare_Dataset[, "Age"] > 50)  # Negation: Age not greater than 50

# Combine logical vectors using "&" (AND), "|" (OR), and "!" (NOT)
HealthCare_Dataset[(HealthCare_Dataset[, "Age"] > 50 & HealthCare_Dataset[, "Blood_Pressure"] > 120), ]  # Both conditions must be true
HealthCare_Dataset[(HealthCare_Dataset[, "Age"] > 50 | HealthCare_Dataset[, "Blood_Pressure"] > 120), ]  # One condition must be true
```

üí° To inspect one column, you can also use the dollar `$` symbol to access a column as a vector.
```{r}
HealthCare_Dataset$Age  # Returns the Age column as a vector
```

üí° You can use the brackets `[]` to select specific rows and columns. Since data frames are bi-dimensional, the first index refers to rows and the second to columns. To select a particular column, you can omit the row index:
```{r}
HealthCare_Dataset[, "Age"]  # All rows in the Age column
```
To select a particular row, omit the column index:
```{r}
HealthCare_Dataset[1, ]  # Row 1 (all columns) 
```

‚úèÔ∏è Exercise on the `HealthCare_Dataset` data frame n¬∞1: import the `HealthCare_Dataset` data frame, inspect its structure, look at different entries, get familiar with those commands.

### Basic descriptive statistics

R makes it simple to compute basic descriptive statistics for exploring your dataset. Below are a few useful examples.

#### Central tendency: mean and median

```{r}
mean(HealthCare_Dataset$Age, na.rm = TRUE)                 # Mean age
median(HealthCare_Dataset$Recovery_Time, na.rm = TRUE)     # Median recovery time
```

üí° The `na.rm` argument in those functions allows for ignoring the NA values.

#### Dispersion: standard deviation, min, max, and range

```{r}
sd(HealthCare_Dataset$Heart_Rate, na.rm = TRUE)            # Standard deviation of heart rate
range(HealthCare_Dataset$Temperature, na.rm = TRUE)        # Range of temperature
min(HealthCare_Dataset$Temperature, na.rm = TRUE)          # Minimum temperature
max(HealthCare_Dataset$Temperature, na.rm = TRUE)          # Maximum temperature
```

#### Frequency tables and proportions

```{r}
table(HealthCare_Dataset$Gender)         # Number of males and females
table(HealthCare_Dataset$Diagnosis)      # Number of patients per diagnosis
prop.table(table(HealthCare_Dataset$Insurance_Type))  # Proportion of insurance types
```

#### Group-wise summaries

```{r}
aggregate(Age ~ Gender, data = HealthCare_Dataset, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
aggregate(Treatment_Duration ~ Medication, data = HealthCare_Dataset, FUN = median, na.rm = TRUE)
```

#### Full overview

```{r}
summary(HealthCare_Dataset)
```

### Modifying data frames

Now, let us assume we want to modify/add/remove one or multiple entries/rows/columns in our data frame. The brackets really come in handy now. In this setting, I recommend defining a new data frame before modifying the original one.

Some examples follow.

```{r}
# Modification of one entry:
HealthCare_Dataset_mod <- HealthCare_Dataset # I generate a copy of the data set, to avoid modifying the original one
head(HealthCare_Dataset_mod)
HealthCare_Dataset_mod[1,3] <- 'Male'
head(HealthCare_Dataset_mod)

# Modification of multiple entries (selecting by condition):
HealthCare_Dataset_mod[!is.na(HealthCare_Dataset_mod$Blood_Pressure) & HealthCare_Dataset_mod$Blood_Pressure < 110, ]$Blood_Pressure <- 101
head(HealthCare_Dataset_mod)
```

‚úèÔ∏è Exercise on the `HealthCare_Dataset` data frame n¬∞2: generate a new data frame selecting only the patients with a blood pressure above 125 and taking insulin as a medication.

### Combining data frames

In practice, data is often spread across multiple data frames that need to be combined. Depending on the structure and goal, there are different ways to combine data frames:

#### Column binding with cbind()

Use `cbind()` to add columns side-by-side. The data frames must have the same number of rows.

```{r}
# Create an additional data frame with the same number of rows
extra_info <- data.frame(
  BMI = c(22.5, 30.2, 24.1, 28.4, 27.0, 23.6),
  Smoking_Status = c("No", "Yes", "No", "Yes", "No", "Yes")
)

# Combine using cbind
combined_df <- cbind(HealthCare_Dataset, extra_info)
head(combined_df)
```

#### Row binding with rbind()

Use `rbind()` to stack data frames vertically. The data frames must have the same column names and types.

```{r}
# Create a new data frame with the same structure (column names and types)
new_patients <- data.frame(
  Patient_ID = c(7, 8),
  Age = c(40, 58),
  Gender = c("Female", "Male"),
  Blood_Pressure = c(110.3, 128.6),
  Heart_Rate = c(72.5, 76.1),
  Temperature = c(98.7, 99.1),
  Diagnosis = c("Cancer", "Influenza"),
  Medication = c("Chemotherapy", "Statins"),
  Treatment_Duration = c(18, 20),
  Insurance_Type = c("Private", "Uninsured"),
  Doctor_Name = c("Dr. Lee", "Dr. Wang"),
  Hospital_Name = c("Children's Hospital", "Healthcare Clinic"),
  Lab_Test_Results = c(110.4, 87.9),
  X.ray_Results = c("Normal", "Abnormal"),
  Surgery_Type = c("Angioplasty", "Appendectomy"),
  Recovery_Time = c(6, 8),
  Allergies = c("None", "Latex"),
  Family_History = c("Hypertension", "Cancer"),
  Patient_Satisfaction = c(3, 4)
)

# Combine using rbind
extended_df <- rbind(HealthCare_Dataset, new_patients)
tail(extended_df)
```

#### Merging with merge() (Join)

Use `merge()` to combine data frames based on a common column, similar to SQL joins.

```{r}
# Create a data frame with additional info based on Patient_ID
patient_notes <- data.frame(
  Patient_ID = c(1, 2, 3),
  Notes = c("Follow-up needed", "Stable", "Requires monitoring")
)

# Merge by Patient_ID (inner join by default)
merged_df <- merge(HealthCare_Dataset, patient_notes, by = "Patient_ID")
head(merged_df)
``` 

You can also specify the type of join:

# Left join: keep all rows from HealthCare_Dataset
left_join_df <- merge(HealthCare_Dataset, patient_notes, by = "Patient_ID", all.x = TRUE)

# Full outer join: keep all rows from both data frames
full_join_df <- merge(HealthCare_Dataset, patient_notes, by = "Patient_ID", all = TRUE)

#### Dealing with NAs

Handling missing data (NAs) is a common task in data analysis. Before deciding how to treat them, it's important to understand where and how often they occur.

```{r}
colSums(is.na(HealthCare_Dataset))              # Number of NAs per column
sum(complete.cases(HealthCare_Dataset))         # Number of rows without any NAs
```

üí° `complete.cases()` returns a logical vector: TRUE if a row has no missing values, and FALSE otherwise.

One way to handle missing data is to remove rows containing NAs. This can be appropriate in some cases, but it should be done with care, as it may introduce bias or reduce sample size. We‚Äôll discuss this further in Chapter 4.

```{r}
# Remove rows with any missing values
HealthCare_Dataset_noNA <- na.omit(HealthCare_Dataset)
```

üí° `na.omit()` drops any row where at least one column is NA.

## Packages

There are a set of standard (or base) packages which are considered part of the R source code and automatically available as part of your R installation. **Base packages** contain the basic functions that allow R to work, and enable standard statistical and graphical functions on datasets.

**Packages** are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format, created to add specific functionality. There are 10,000+ user contributed packages and growing. You can install packages using the install.packages() function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# To install a package, you can use the function 
install.packages("dplyr")

# To load a package you've already install, just load it using the library() function
library(dyplr)
```

‚úèÔ∏è Exercise on packages: install the `ggplot2` package. We will need it for Chapter 2.

# Solutions to the exercises

Please not that those are only examples, there are always many ways to solve the same task!

‚òëÔ∏è Create your own script: I don't think any solution is necessary üòâ.

‚òëÔ∏è Exercise on Booleans:

```{r}
ages <- c(35, 45, 60, 15, 50, 8)
eligible <- ages >= 18
eligible
```

‚òëÔ∏è Create a data frame and compute standardized scores of `blood_pressure`:

```{r}
# Create the data frame
(df <- data.frame(id = 1:10, 
                 blood_pressure = rnorm(10, mean = 123, sd = 8),
                 group = factor(sample(c("drug 1", "drug 2", "obs arm"), 10, replace = TRUE))))

# Compute standardized scores for blood pressure
df$stand_score <- scale(df$blood_pressure)

# Alternatively, compute by hand (standardized score = (x - Œº) / œÉ)
df$stand_score_2 <- (df$blood_pressure - mean(df$blood_pressure))/sd(df$blood_pressure)

# View the data frame with standardized scores
df
```

‚òëÔ∏è Write a function `sum_squared`:

```{r}
sum_squared <- function(int1, int2){
  sum_of_squares <- int1^2 + int2^2
  return(sum_of_squares)
}

sum_squared(3, 5)
```

‚úèÔ∏è Exercise on the `HealthCare_Dataset` data frame n¬∞1: Did you manage to select a specific column you were interested in? Were you able to check how many men and women are included in the dataset? Here are a few examples of operations you can use to explore the data set.
```{r}
# View the first few rows of the dataset
head(HealthCare_Dataset)

# Display the names of all columns
names(HealthCare_Dataset)

# View all unique values in the "Medication" column
unique(HealthCare_Dataset$Medication)

# Count how many men and women are in the dataset
table(HealthCare_Dataset$Gender)

# Get a quick statistical summary of numeric columns
summary(HealthCare_Dataset)

# View the number of missing values in each column
colSums(is.na(HealthCare_Dataset))

# Calculate the average age
mean(HealthCare_Dataset$Age, na.rm = TRUE)
```

‚úèÔ∏è Exercise on the `HealthCare_Dataset` data frame n¬∞2:
```{r}
# Filter the dataset to include only patients with blood pressure above 125 and taking insulin as a medication
HealthCare_Dataset_ex2 <- HealthCare_Dataset[HealthCare_Dataset$Medication == "Insulin" & HealthCare_Dataset$Blood_Pressure > 125, ]
head(HealthCare_Dataset_ex2)
```
