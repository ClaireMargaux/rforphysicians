# Basics of coding in R

R is a free and open source statistical computing and graphics software.
RStudio is a user-friendly environment for R, designed to facilitate its accessibility. 
R can technically be used without RStudio (although I wouldn't advise it), but the reverse is not possible. 
To download both, follow the links below:

* [**Download R**](https://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/)
* [**Download RStudio**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

Once you have downloaded both programs and opened RStudio, you will be presented with a window similar to the one shown in Figure \ref{fig:rstudio-window-start}.

```{r rstudio-window-start, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "RStudio window"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/rstudio-window-start.png")
```

* Left pane: Contains the Console, Terminal and Background Jobs tabs.
* Top right pane: contains the Environment, History, Connections and Tutorial tabs.
* Bottom right pane: contains the Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer and Presentation tabs.

## Console

In the **Console tab**, we first see information about the version of R we are using and some basic commands to try out. At the end of these descriptions, we can type our R code, press Enter and see the result below the code line.

\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r, echo=TRUE}
2+2
```

## Help

The `help()` function and `?` help operator in R provide access to the documentation pages for R functions, data sets, and other objects, both for packages in the standard R distribution and for contributed packages.

You can access help directly from the console or via the Help tab in the bottom right-hand corner.

\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r}
help(c)
# or equivalently
? c
```

## Script file

However, when we run our code directly in the console, it isn't saved for being reproduced further. If we need (and we usually do) to write a reproducible code to solve a specific task, we have to record and regularly save it in a **script file** rather than in the console.

To start recording a script, click *File – New File – R Script*. This will open a text editor in the top-left corner of the RStudio interface (above the Console tab, see Figure \ref{fig:rstudio-window}).

```{r rstudio-window, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "RStudio window"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/rstudio-window.png")
```

## Comments

Comments can be added to the code in a script using the hash symbol.

\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r}
# Here is your script.
```

It is very, very important that you always comment every piece of your code, to make sure:

* that you will still be able to understand what you have written after a few months/years.
* to facilitate sharing: without comments, it will take someone much longer to understand your code.

So for scientific purposes, please **comment your code**!

## Objects, data types, variables

In R, everything is an **object**. This means that every piece of data you work with, from a single number to a complex dataset, is represented as an object with specific properties and behaviours. An object has attributes like class (data type) and dimensions.

**Variables** are labels: They act as pointers to the actual object stored in memory, and appear in the Environment tab.

To better grasp the difference, here is an example.

\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r}
# We create an object named 'vec' and assign a sequence of numbers to it.
vec <- 1:10 

# 'vec' is the variable. The sequence of numbers (1, 2, 3, ..., 10) is the object.
```

To assign values to an object, use the '<-' or '=' symbols.

### Data types

In R, data types define the kind of information a variable can hold. Here are some of the key data types:

* Numeric: Represents real numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5, 0).

\vspace{0.2cm}
        
```{r} 
typeof(3.14) 
```

* Integer: Represents whole numbers (e.g., 2L, -5L). The "L" suffix indicates an integer.

\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r} 
typeof(2L) 
```

* Logical: Represents Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE).

\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r} 
typeof(TRUE)
```

* Character: Represents text or strings (e.g., "hello", "world").

\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r} 
typeof("hello")
```

* Complex: Represents complex numbers (e.g., 1 + 2i).

\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r} 
typeof(1 + 2i) 
```

#### NAs/NANs

In R, missing values are represented by the symbol NA (not available). Impossible values (e.g., dividing by zero) are represented by the symbol NaN (not a number). Unlike SAS, R uses the same symbol for character and numeric data.

### Objects

* Vectors:
  + The most fundamental data structure.
  + A one-dimensional array of elements of the same data type (e.g., numeric, character, logical).
  + Created using the `c()` function.
  
\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r, echo=TRUE}
vec1 <- c(1,2,3)
vec1

# Or equivalently (only for integers!)
vec2 <- 1:3
vec2

# Or equivalently (only for equally spaced values!)
vec3 <- seq(from=1, to=3, by=1)
vec3

# To look only at some elements in the vector, we can specify
# which indices we are interested in inside brackets [].
# (Note: in R, indices start with 1.)
vec1[1]
vec2[c(2,3)]
```

* Matrices:
  + Two-dimensional arrays of elements of the same data type.
  + Can be created using the `matrix()` function.
  
\vspace{0.2cm}
  
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mat <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
mat
```

* Arrays:
  + Generalization of matrices to multiple dimensions.
  
\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r, echo=TRUE}
array <- array(1:8, c(2,4,2))
array
```

* Data Frames:
  +Two-dimensional tabular data structure.
  + Can hold columns of different data types.
  + The most common data structure for representing datasets in R.
  
\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r}
d <- data.frame(id = 1:10, val = c(4,5,2,6,7,9,3,5,8,7))
d
```

* Lists:
  + Ordered collections of objects of any type (including other lists).
  + Can hold elements of different data types within a single list.
  
\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r}
list <- list(numb = 10:15, char = 'hello')
list
```

* Factors:
  + Categorical variables.
  + Represent data with a limited number of possible values.

\vspace{0.2cm}
  
```{r}
fac <- factor(c("single", "married"))
fac
```

* Functions:
  + Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
  + Also considered objects in R.

\vspace{0.2cm}
  
```{r}
frac <- function(nominator, denominator) {
  res <- nominator/denominator
  return(res)
}
frac(6,2)
```

## Working directory

When you get a file from somewhere on your computer (e.g. a dataset), you can either 

* have it in your **R working directory** (see below), in which case you don't need to specify the full path to the file when you import it, 
* or you can get files in different folders, by always specifying the full path.

The advantage of putting the files in the folder that contains your script and is set as the working directory is that you can easily move the folder around on your computer without getting any problems with your script: just set the working directory to your source file every time you open it, and you'll be fine.

\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Example
setwd("~home/user/Documents/Trials/VANCO/Analysis5")
data <- read.csv("testdata.csv")
```

The advantage of always giving the full path to a file is that you can get data in different folders on your computer, avoiding things like copying the source data in every folder where you have a corresponding script.

\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Example
data <- read.csv("/home/user/Documents/Trials/VANCO/Data/testdata.csv")
```

**Working directory**

To tell R which folder you are working in (e.g. where you have your data), you can either go to *Session - Set working directory - Choose directory* and choose the folder you want, or use the `setwd()` function, or more directly set your working directory to the folder where your R script is located, via *Session - Set working directory - To source file location*.

I personally recommend that you put your script in the folder you set as your working directory, to avoid forgetting where the script has to look for data.

## Import data

We will study the case CSV to R data frame.

CSV is expanded as Comma, Separated, Values. In a CSV file, the values stored are separated by a comma. This process of storing the data is much easier.

After the setting of the working path/determining the path of your CSV file, you can import your data set using the function `read.csv`, which should always create a data frame. To check the class of the variable ‘readfile’, use the function `class'.

\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dataset <- read.csv("testdata.txt")
class(dataset)
```

I recommend using data frames for your data, it is a much easier format to understand than matrices if you are not used to it.

## Data frames

Let us now look at a data frame to learn how to call or modify its elements. To do this, we will use a data set available in Base R.

```{r}
data.diamonds <- diamonds
class(data.diamonds) # we check the class
head(data.diamonds) # we look at the first rows
```
**Diamonds**: *A dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. The variables are as follows: price, carat, cut, color, clarity, x, y, z, depth, table.*

\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r}
# To inspect one columns, we can use the dollar $ symbol.
# (Let us only look at the first 10 entries).
data.diamonds$carat[1:10]

# Alternatively, you can give the index of the desired column.
# As data frames are bi-dimentional, you need to specify in the brackets []
# a value for the rows and one for the columns.
data.diamonds[1:10, 1]

# If you don't give any value, you get all the rows/columns.
data.diamonds[1:10, ]
```

Note that both approaches don't yield the same data format! When plotting/analysing, favour using the dollar sign.

Now, let us assume we want to modify one entry/multiple entries in our data frame. The brackets come in handy now. In this setting, I recommend defining a new data frame before modifying the original one.

Some examples follow.

\vspace{0.2cm}

```{r}
# Modification of one entry:
data.diamonds.mod <- data.diamonds
head(data.diamonds.mod)
data.diamonds.mod[1,1] <- 0.4
head(data.diamonds.mod)

# Modification of multiple entries (selecting by condition):
data.diamonds.mod[data.diamonds.mod$cut == 'Premium', ]$depth <- 3.00
head(data.diamonds.mod)

# Suppression of rows with NAs
data.diamonds.noNA <- na.omit(data.diamonds)
```

## Packages

There are a set of standard (or base) packages which are considered part of the R source code and automatically available as part of your R installation. **Base packages** contain the basic functions that allow R to work, and enable standard statistical and graphical functions on datasets.

**Packages** are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format, created to add specific functionality. There are 10,000+ user contributed packages and growing. You can install packages using the install.packages() function.
